This interdisciplinary service-learning course introduces students to socially responsible and global leadership. It emphasizes the ethical use of technology for community betterment, with hands-on projects that combine technical knowledge and civic engagement. As part of the course, students acquire basic skills in circuitry and solar energy, and travel to underserved communities—such as rural regions in Africa—to install solar-powered lighting systems. The course fosters empathy, cross-cultural communication, and a strong sense of civic responsibility.
